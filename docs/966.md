您想在 Java 开发环境中使用高性能图形吗？你一直想编写一个游戏，但你的图像移动速度不够快吗？您的幻灯片放映程序是否无法正常工作，因为您无法控制用户的显示分辨率？如果您一直在询问这些问题，那么 1.4 版中引入的全屏独占模式 API 可能正是您所需要的。

[Full-Screen Exclusive Mode](exclusivemode.html)

Full-screen exclusive mode is a powerful new feature that enables you to suspend the windowing system so that drawing can be done directly to the screen.

[Display Mode](displaymode.html)

This section describes how to choose and set the display mode. It also discusses why you'd want to set the display mode in the first place.

[Passive vs. Active Rendering](rendering.html)

This section discusses the merits of passive and active rendering. For example, painting while on the main event loop using the `paint` method is passive, whereas rendering in your own thread is active. Active rendering tips are also listed.

[Double Buffering and Page Flipping](doublebuf.html)

This section explains double buffering and introduces page-flipping, a double buffering technique available in full-screen exclusive mode.

[BufferStrategy and BufferCapabilities](bufferstrategy.html)

This section covers `java.awt.image.BufferStrategy`, a class that allows you to draw to surfaces and components without having to know the number of buffers used or the technique used to display them. This section also reviews `java.awt.BufferCapabilities`, a class that can help you determine the capabilities of your graphics device.

[Examples](example.html)

This page lists several full-screen exclusive mode examples.
